# Voodoo-test

<p>It's test task</p>
<p>The site was made by me in 22 hours of work from 0, according to the layout. </p>
<p>Demonstrates my web development skills at the end of July 2023, as well as my ability to learn quickly, since I was not familiar with tailwind, before starting work on the site, which is used to write the entire styling of the site. </p>

<p>It has responsive markup: </p>
<ul>
<li>With a screen width of up to 390px, the width of the content depends on the screen width.</li>
<li>With a width above 390px, adaptive layout for tablets and desktop devices is implemented separately. </li>
</ul>
